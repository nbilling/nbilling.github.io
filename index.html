        <p>
          Today I want to write down thoughts I had on a C++ game
          engine. Now that I'm on the home stretch with the top-down shooter in Unity and expanding content
          for that, my mind is free to wander onto planning for next time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started reading <a href="">Game Programming in C++</a> by Sanjay Madhav and have found it a
          <strong>surprisingly</strong> light read given the spooky subject matter. I like the "game object"
          model he suggests, it's roughly like the UE one-- game objects are <strong>Actors</strong> and you
          attach <strong>Components</strong> to them. Stuff like a sprite to be rendered is a Component (this
          is also very similar to how you use Components in Unity of course). It has great sample code that
          sets up this framework and uses it in an easy to follow way. I understand why it doesn't go into
          object reuse (or I wasn't able to find it if he does) but I wish there were a chapter in the back
          that discussed ways to pool and reuse Actors/Components. Ditto for custom binary formats and
          custom tools for asset processing/creation. Enough of that I'm getting carried away again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm glad I messed around with the projects from the book and went down the path of using SDL2, too.
          SDL2 seems great so far. Maybe at some time in the future I'll want to pull out rendering code I'm
          writing on top of SDL2 now and do it in OpenGL or Vulkan, but I doubt I'll need to for this next
          project, and SDL2 handles input just fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          After my little existential crisis about how to effectively pool the inheritance hierarchy of Actors
          and Components was resolved, it was about time to have one for the format of maps and game data!
          I've used json before for this kind of stuff, but for maps I don't think it's even worth trying to
          use json. The requirements I settled on were that the overall system had to allow me to edit maps
          graphically and game data in a normal text editor. For one thing that means I need to make my own
          map editor, which I was already planning on, and that I either need to load game data as strings
          or I need a compiler. So far so good. I had a near breakdown trying to get my VS C++ project to
          automatically generate headers from flatbuffers .fbs files-- which involved going so far as to recreate
          the entire project in cmake just so that cmake could figure out how to achieve that build step for me...
          Ultimately, though I decided in the interest of my sanity that I would just use a custom, very simple,
          text format for my game data files and write a custom parser and compiler for it (credit to
          <a href="https://youtu.be/jlS1Y2-yKV0">javidx</a> for this inspiration).
        </p>
        <p>
          My little untextured raycasting engine is humming along, it has a map editor with a paint brush and
          an eraser. The UI is next up and I have many grandiose intentions toward that too. I think I will
          have a visual tree like the Unity canvas where the nodes use their parents position as an offset when
          drawing themselves but they can be as wide/tall as they want, there will be some function that runs
          once per frame and does a "raycast" through the mouse pointer to find the highest Z-order bounding
          box in the UI it's overlapping and send enter/exit/click events. I don't think UI objects will have
          any components, they can just have nested objects that implement whatever functionality I want to
          compose. Until that fails horribly, that's the plan.
        </p>
        <h3>2024-09-25 Part 2</h3>
        <p>
          During work on this top-down shooter game it also happened that I had to start ditching the PhysX
          implementations of motion and collision detection. The precise detail of movement in a game, to me,
          is too important to leave to a black box. So the first thing to go was the player's motion-- now the
          player controller code can manually keep track of its velocity and apply acceleration and drag, and
          "collide n' slide" with level geometry exactly the way that feels good. After that it didn't make
          sense to use PhysX to move monsters either. In this kind of game the monsters move at static speeds,
          they don't need any inertia. The player controller, monsters, projectiles-- now they all have custom
          physics code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, to get field of view and fog of war to work they way I wanted, I had to write a raycasting
          algorithm on the game's tilemaps (remember this is a top-down game). So in spite of this being a 3D
          game engine rendering quads in an orthographic projection where the distance never changes, and all
          this other bending over backwards... I still end up raycasting in a tile grid like a wolf3d
          renderer (<a href="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html">this is my ALL TIME favourite webpage</a>
          on raycasting, although I didn't know it existed at the time I was writing the raycaster for the
          top-down shooter).
        </p>
        <p>
          As all this is unfolding, I start thinking about my next game. I would love to do something 3D but I
          don't want to transition to meshes yet. At this point I'm planning to keep using Unity for the
          foreseeable future, so the first thing I have to work out is how to represent the 3D level geometry in
          Unity. The file format doesn't really matter-- I mean it can't be a scene exactly because Unity is a
          "true" 3D renderer-- but it can be tiles or linedefs, stored in binary or text. I could load that
          stuff into Unity and generate a mesh (or meshes) for static level geometry and then use Unity's 3D
          renderer to render the game.
          </p>
        <p>
          I spent several weeks thinking about alternative implementations of that, but in the end it just
          seemed like replacing all the physics in Unity and then generating mesh geometry to workaround the 3D
          renderer is doing too much to shoehorn my game into the wrong engine. The straw that broke the camels
          back was me trying to work out how to do collisions with level geometry. The simple thing to do would
          be generating a mesh collider from the generated level mesh, but then how do you handle doors, lifts,
          and moving platforms? You can keep track of vertices and move those around, but then to make collisions
          work you'd have to update the mesh collider it generated. Every frame? No way will that run fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could create a separate mesh for the level geometry that moves, and move that instead of moving
          vertices. That's what a "true" 3D game would certainly do, but then it's making this geometry generation
          system even more complicated, and it's not how this game is fundamentally structured.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's as though I'd started running into all these kludges that would be necessary to accommodate the
          basic structure of my game in Unity, before I'd even written a line of code. This is making me very
          frustrated! Okay what if I take a step back. Rendering a map from linedefs is a bit overwhelming since
          it's my first time writing the renderer and I'm doing it from scratch-- probably need real space
          partitioning (eg. BSP) even to raycast against walls. Raycasting on a grid is much simpler, and I've
          done it recently for my top-down shooter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If level geometry is a grid then the same raycast algorithm works for rendering and for physics,
          leaving aside how we render, LoS, and collide with dynamic objects. Doors work pretty elegantly in a
          grid-- it's just one type of tile. The renderer can offset it from the walls by adjusting the height it
          draws the columns of door, and the same thing works for making doors open/close vertically. Colliding 
          with doors requires no special work at all, you just have overlap/raycast tests take the door state into
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now I've got this decision to make: strip requirements way back to a wolf3d-like game and write my
          own engine in C++, or keep hacking away at Unity and start generating meshes for 2.5D level geometry
          with the aim of eventually tunneling out the "other side" into 3D with meshes and skeletal animation
          in Unity where I can finally drop all the kludges and workarounds?
        </p>
        <p>
          No spoilers, but you know which one sounds more exciting right?
        </p>
        <h3>2024-09-25</h3>
        <p>
          Since I released SprawlRacer I've been working with a
          <a href="https://bahototh.blogspot.com/">great artist</a> on a top-down shooter
          (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtNPJlVJvK4">demo footage</a>). The level creation workflow
          for this game is more involved than it was for SprawlRacer. The map is visually more complicated
          and there are puzzles and encounters, all that stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm glad that I had some experience making maps (and making a workflow for making maps...) in SprawlRacer
          first. Lots of problems repeated and other ones that came up were less overwhelming because they were
          extensions of what I'd seen before. I needed a trigger system for switches to open doors and for keys to
          allow the player to manually open doors, teleporters needed to connect with one another, levels needed some
          way to tell the game which level an exit led to. I didn't want to create versions of every door/trigger/exit
          in the game data or in a Unity prefab, so for this kind of "edit time" configuration I put fields on the
          spawner game objects that write their value to the object they spawn when the level first loads.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some kinds of objects I found that a symbolic Gizmo wasn't easy enough to read, for example "props"
          which vary greatly in size and whose colliders are important to the gameplay of a level. I had to write editor
          scripts for prop spawners to read the size of colliders from game data and display it as a wireframe Gizmo.
          It's cool that you can do this in Unity so easily, and it made we wonder what it would be like make a stripped
          down level editor specialized for what my particular game needs. And maybe if I'm creating solutions to all
          these things in Unity and carrying them forward from one project to the next, if I solved them in my own editor
          then I could carry that forward too.
        </p>
        <h3>2024-09-20</h3>
        <p>
          Today I'll talk a bit about my experience setting up the Unity editor to edit levels for a game. You have the
          freedom in Unity to make a "level" whatever you want. It could be a self-contained scene, it could be entirely
          your
          own data scheme and reconstituted onto a blank scene at load time, or anything in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          SprawlRacer didn't allow saving in the middle of a race so I never had to think about how to
          serialize/deserialize
          the state of all the game objects in the scene. Static level "geometry" consisted of layered tilemaps, dynamic
          objects like pedestrians and pick-ups would get spawned in by spawner objects, the spline the AI used to
          navigate
          the track was just a built-in Unity spline component. Unity made laying out all those elements in each track
          fairly intuitive so, to me, using the Unity editor as my level editor was a no-brainer. The definitions of all
          these
          elements was done with Unity prefabs since there weren't many of them to keep track of, although I had started
          to move
          some things into json files when there were a lot of variations (eg. the roster of AI racers, the lists of
          tracks
          for each division).
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my first experience designing levels and coming up with a workflow for creating them. You can go
          pretty far
          with the Unity editor just plopping prefabs down, but it didn't take long for me to get frustrated by the
          fiddly-ness
          and difficulty in "reading" the scene view of the map. I made a few changes to the editor experience for my
          own
          convenience. Most notable of which was creating custom Gizmo textures for object spawners, racer starting
          points, etc.
          Below is a screenshot of the Unity "scene view" of a SprawlRacer level being edited, notice the yellow Gizmos
          all
          over.
        </p>
        <button class="imgLink"><img src="SprawlRacerLevelEditing.png" /></button>
        <aside>Also notice the crappy art, hehe</aside>
        <p>
          Almost all the physics of SprawlRacer was built in PhysX stuff too. Dynamic objects had built-in 2d box/circle
          colliders and static geometry used the built-in precombined tilemap collision mesh component.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was totally new to designing a level format, I knew I was going to make all the levels myself, the level
          state didn't need to be serialized/deserialized, and rendering/physics wasn't going to deviate from the Unity
          built-in happy path. So naturally I never considered making a custom level editor and level format. My
          "levels" ended
          up being somewhat of a hybrid-- common scenes that get loaded first and then the track scene layered on top of
          that
          additively.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did learn a few things along the way that started me down the custom format path, however. First, the idea
          of
          separating the dynamic object (eg. pick-up) from the marker in the level that spawns it is a step towards
          thinking
          of a level format as distinct from a Unity scene. Second, the convenience of defining all the AI racers and
          track/division info as json made me want to move as much game data as possible into a custom format (text
          files) for
          my next game. Below is an example of some json defining an AI racer in the SprawlRacer game data.
        </p>
        <button class="imgLink"><img src="SprawlRacerJson.png" /></button>
        <aside>
          Not pictured is how <strong>all</strong> game data resided in a single gigantic text file and this made it a
          pain to
          edit. That's a small detail that I'd change for the next game...
        </aside>

        <h3>2024-09-19</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the first post of nbilling's webpage!</p>
        <p>I promise future posts will be shorter and lighter, this one ended up being a sort of a confession.</p>
        <p>
          I will post here about making games, or other programming. But if I'm being honest I mostly just like
          programming games.
          I've started many game projects that I never finished, but two games that I did finish are
          <a href="http://nbilling.itch.io/megacollider">MegaCollider</a> and
          <a href="http://nbilling.itch.io/sprawlracer">SprawlRacer</a>. Each of them I finished in about 3 months,
          starting with
          MegaCollider.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to making MegaCollider I had been working on a game named
          <a href="https://youtu.be/PfXV07qJ6v8?si=GqBr0MhMw-Zbtdt7">TetraMage</a> for close to 3 <strong>years</strong>
          without
          being close to releasing it. At that point I felt, on the one hand really glad that I had been working
          consistently
          on this game for so long, but on the other hand rather frustrated with the pace of progress. I still hadn't
          released
          anything! TetraMage had itself been inspired by the idea that maybe if I scaled down the scope of my prior
          game ideas
          to something "boring" in terms of the underlying technology and focus all my efforts on just finishing
          something fun,
          then I could stop starting and quickly abandoning prototypes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I reached peak frustration with TetraMage (in late 2023?) I actually started an even more grandiose
          project that
          I wasted months on before finally getting a good idea. Make the smallest possible thing that is fun to me and
          that I can
          release. Time box it to 3 months-- any features that don't make it or bugs that I can't fix just get dropped
          at the end.
          That one was MegaCollider. Almost no art assets, no level design, almost all the physics is just PhysX in
          Unity out of
          the box. But I think it's fun and just recently I took a look at it after months of not thinking about it and
          it was
          much better than I remember.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned a bunch of interesting lessons (Note: interesting for me-- I once got some good advice from a
          colleague to the
          effect of "just because a problem was hard for you doesn't make it a hard problem"), I was proud of finishing
          it, and
          felt so great being able to start from scratch on my next game. The next one relaxed some of the constraints
          of the
          former. Now there were going to be art assets, but I was working alone so only things I could pull off myself.
          There
          would be level design, but again it has to be something I'm capable of on my own in 3 months. I was still
          going to use
          the Unity engine and-- importantly!-- I was going to reuse as much code as possible. By the way that was
          SprawlRacer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being able to reuse so much code in SprawlRacer was a lightbulb moment for me. Reusing code doesn't have to
          mean
          packaging it into a library with unit tests and putting it in a public repo. Frankly that kind of thing is
          such a drag
          and I really wonder how (or if?) people who do this with game code are able to be productive. Maybe they work
          at game
          companies with too many programmers solving the same problems, who knows? At my own work obviously I engage in
          this sort
          of thing but there it's culturally ingrained and probably domain-appropriate (we don't ship a boxed product
          every X years,
          let alone an entertainment product).
        </p>
        <p>
          Somewhere in this period I started intensely enjoying making these games, rather than just doing it because I
          didn't
          want to die without producing any work that was personally meaningful. I changed my daily schedule so I could
          get up
          several hours before my family does and work on a game while I was fresh, rather than doing it after my kids
          went to
          sleep, and frequently just being too tired to get anything done. I also started to realize what parts of the
          process
          were causing hang-ups or making it less fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest one is "bad constraints". Most constraints are good, I reckon.
          Having a deadline is good, obligations in your life that dictate a daily rhythm are good, having a budget is
          good,
          having some fixed rendering, physics, editor, etc. technology is good. Bad ones are things that take away your
          ability
          to "just get on with it", maybe things that move the locus of control from inside to outside. Being
          constrained to
          art "assets" from a store or free website is a "bad" constraint to me. I found that I'd rather create crappy
          art myself.
          "Crappy art" constraint is a good constraint to me. Needing to hire someone or depend on someone who's not
          already said
          they were going to work with you is a "bad" constraint to me. Having to make a simple design overly
          complicated to fit it
          into a really general-purpose techonology stack is a "bad" constraint IMO too. This last one I've coped with
          in Unity for
          a while but more about that another time.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I finished SprawlRacer I had several things I was unhappy with about the game that I wanted to do
          differently, which
          is a huge perk of making things on a short time limit. For the next game I was committed to it being a
          top-down shooter
          with animated sprites (even if I had to make the crappy animations myself!), a campaign of hand-made levels,
          and puzzles.
          As I was wrapping up SprawlRacer I took a risk (risk for me, being that I am terrified of rejection) by
          reaching out to
          several people who had posted online that they were artists looking for programmers to collaborate with. I was
          still
          committed to starting and finishing when I said for this next game, but if someone else wanted to collaborate
          with me
          then that's a win-win. If not then I plan accordingly and do it on my own-- and I had already started
          producing
          prototype crappy art for the game at that point. Happily one person responded and we hit it off, so that game
          is
          underway and I'm glad is very much on track.
        </p>
        <p>
          In future posts I'll share some of what I've learned from my current project-- my first one with a
          collaborator, maybe
          some media from that game, and my plans for once that's released.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modest as the two games I've finished are, I am still proud of them and very grateful for the lessons that
          I've learned
          that led to me making them. It took me decades of not getting started, and then doing it the wrong way, but I
          can't be
          mad now that I feel like I'm finally going in the right direction.
        <p>Cheers!</p>
