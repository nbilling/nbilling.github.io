            <h3>2024-09-19</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the first post of nbilling's webpage!</p>
            <p>I promise future posts will be shorter and lighter, this one ended up being a sort of a confession.</p>
            <p>
              I will post here about making games, or other programming. But if I'm being honest I mostly just like programming games.
              I've started many game projects that I never finished, but two games that I did finish are
              <a href="http://nbilling.itch.io/megacollider">MegaCollider</a> and
              <a href="http://nbilling.itch.io/sprawlracer">SprawlRacer</a>. Each of them I finished in about 3 months, starting with
              MegaCollider.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to making MegaCollider I had been working on a game named
              <a href="https://youtu.be/PfXV07qJ6v8?si=GqBr0MhMw-Zbtdt7">TetraMage</a> for close to 3 <strong>years</strong> without
              being close to releasing it. At that point I felt, on the one hand really glad that I had been working consistently
              on this game for so long, but on the other hand rather frustrated with the pace of progress. I still hadn't released
              anything! TetraMage had itself been inspired by the idea that maybe if I scaled down the scope of my prior game ideas
              to something "boring" in terms of the underlying technology and focus all my efforts on just finishing something fun,
              then I could stop starting and quickly abandoning prototypes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When I reached peak frustration with TetraMage (in late 2023?) I actually started an even more grandiose project that
              I wasted months on before finally getting a good idea. Make the smallest possible thing that is fun to me and that I can
              release. Time box it to 3 months-- any features that don't make it or bugs that I can't fix just get dropped at the end.
              That one was MegaCollider. Almost no art assets, no level design, almost all the physics is just PhysX in Unity out of
              the box. But I think it's fun and just recently I took a look at it after months of not thinking about it and it was
              much better than I remember. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned a bunch of interesting lessons (Note: interesting for me-- I once got some good advice from a colleague to the
              effect of "just because a problem was hard for you doesn't make it a hard problem"), I was proud of finishing it, and
              felt so great being able to start from scratch on my next game. The next one relaxed some of the constraints of the
              former. Now there were going to be art assets, but I was working alone so only things I could pull off myself. There
              would be level design, but again it has to be something I'm capable of on my own in 3 months. I was still going to use
              the Unity engine and-- importantly!-- I was going to reuse as much code as possible. By the way that was SprawlRacer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being able to reuse so much code in SprawlRacer was a lightbulb moment for me. Reusing code doesn't have to mean
              packaging it into a library with unit tests and putting it in a public repo. Frankly that kind of thing is such a drag
              and I really wonder how (or if?) people who do this with game code are able to be productive. Maybe they work at game
              companies with too many programmers solving the same problems, who knows? At my own work obviously I engage in this sort
              of thing but there it's culturally ingrained and probably domain-appropriate (we don't ship a boxed product every X years,
              let alone an entertainment product).
            </p>
            <p>
              Somewhere in this period I started intensely enjoying making these games, rather than just doing it because I didn't
              want to die without producing any work that was personally meaningful. I changed my daily schedule so I could get up
              several hours before my family does and work on a game while I was fresh, rather than doing it after my kids went to
              sleep, and frequently just being too tired to get anything done. I also started to realize what parts of the process
              were causing hang-ups or making it less fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest one is "bad constraints". Most constraints are good, I reckon.
              Having a deadline is good, obligations in your life that dictate a daily rhythm are good, having a budget is good,
              having some fixed rendering, physics, editor, etc. technology is good. Bad ones are things that take away your ability
              to "just get on with it", maybe things that move the locus of control from inside to outside. Being constrained to
              art "assets" from a store or free website is a "bad" constraint to me. I found that I'd rather create crappy art myself.
              "Crappy art" constraint is a good constraint to me. Needing to hire someone or depend on someone who's not already said
              they were going to work with you is a "bad" constraint to me. Having to make a simple design overly complicated to fit it
              into a really general-purpose techonology stack is a "bad" constraint IMO too. This last one I've coped with in Unity for
              a while but more about that another time.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I finished SprawlRacer I had several things I was unhappy with about the game that I wanted to do differently, which
              is a huge perk of making things on a short time limit. For the next game I was committed to it being a top-down shooter
              with animated sprites (even if I had to make the crappy animations myself!), a campaign of hand-made levels, and puzzles.
              As I was wrapping up SprawlRacer I took a risk (risk for me, being that I am terrified of rejection) by reaching out to
              several people who had posted online that they were artists looking for programmers to collaborate with. I was still
              committed to starting and finishing when I said for this next game, but if someone else wanted to collaborate with me
              then that's a win-win. If not then I plan accordingly and do it on my own-- and I had already started producing
              prototype crappy art for the game at that point. Happily one person responded and we hit it off, so that game is
              underway and I'm glad is very much on track.
            </p>
            <p>
              In future posts I'll share some of what I've learned from my current project-- my first one with a collaborator, maybe
              some media from that game, and my plans for once that's released.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modest as the two games I've finished are, I am still proud of them and very grateful for the lessons that I've learned
              that led to me making them. It took me decades of not getting started, and then doing it the wrong way, but I can't be
              mad now that I feel like I'm finally going in the right direction.
            <p>Cheers!</p>
